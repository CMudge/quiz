<h2>User Guide</h2>
<h3>Welcome to the Quiz App!</h3> 
<p>This is a location-based quiz game. All you have to do is walk around and request the nearest question, either by clicking the 'Find Questions' button, or by clicking on the 'Find closest question' button in the side menu. If you are outside, these location-based services will work better.</p>
<p>When a question pops up, four possible answers will be displayed. You have to select one and submit your answer by clicking on the 'Submit Answer' button. You will be told straight away if your answer was correct or not.</p>

<h3>The Side Bar</h3>
<p> The 'Home' button reloads the page.
The 'Find Closest Question' button displays the question that is nearest your your location.
The 'User Guide' button opens this page.</p>

<h3>Trouble Shooting</h3>
<p> If you're receiving always the same question, try to move further away in another direction.</p>

<h3>How your data is used</h3>
<p>Your answers are completely anonymous. Only your mobile phone IP address and the answer you submitted will be stored in a database, and these details will not be shared with any third party.</p>
